# AI-Generated Documentation

This page explains how AI is used in the Provide Foundry documentation and what that means for readers.

## What Does "AI-Generated" Mean?

Much of the documentation across the Provide Foundry ecosystem was created with significant assistance from AI language models (primarily Claude). This includes:

- API reference documentation
- Conceptual explanations
- Code examples
- Tutorials and guides

## Why Are We Disclosing This?

Transparency matters. We want you to know:

1. **Content may contain errors** - AI-generated text can include inaccuracies, outdated information, or misunderstandings of the codebase
2. **We're actively auditing** - Documentation is being reviewed and corrected by human maintainers
3. **Your feedback helps** - If you spot an issue, please let us know

## Our Review Process

All AI-generated documentation goes through:

1. **Initial Generation** - AI assists with drafting based on source code and existing docs
2. **Technical Review** - Maintainers verify accuracy against actual implementation
3. **Ongoing Audit** - Continuous improvement as issues are discovered

## How to Report Issues

Found something incorrect or confusing?

- **GitHub Issues**: [Report a documentation issue](https://github.com/provide-io/provide-foundry/issues/new?labels=documentation)
- **Pull Requests**: Contributions are welcome

## What We're Working On

- Completing technical audits of all auto-generated content
- Adding more human-written conceptual documentation
- Improving code examples with tested, working code
- Expanding tutorials with real-world use cases

## Our Commitment

We're committed to maintaining high-quality documentation. The AI disclosure warning will remain until we've completed our audit process and are confident in the accuracy of the content.
